review everything before going to main (understand if it is good to break up some stuff into more functions)!
use HYPREStructMatrixAddToValues to change the diagonal term of the matrix, to solve the helmholtz eq!
structure solver into:

initialize, setup, add_to_diagonal (over-write a current solver), solve, destroy

For implicit diffusion:
(1) initialize (once)
(2) setup without diagonal (once)
(3) change diagonal (new asolver, save the old one with) (every substep)
(4) solve
(5) destroy this this new asolver (but keep the old one!) (every substep)

ADD BCs a la phase change code! :)
IF IMPLICIT DIFFUSION and not periodic determine q which is equal to 1 where bound(ijk,nb) is true and zero elsewhere. Then do hi = hi-q (e.g.) q = [0,1,0] for right bound when we are solving Helmholtz for v

Maybe change things to capital F

need to change hi(:) when calling:
  (1) init_solver, (2) setup_sovler, (3) solve, (4) updt_rhs_b
(1) change all c_or_f to is_centered
(2) add shift inside the solver when is_centered is false
(3) change all solver subroutines accordingly

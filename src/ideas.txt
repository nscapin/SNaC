review everything before going to main (understand if it is good to break up some stuff into more functions)!
add subroutine compute_tau in debug
add saving of the grid and geo file in initgrid.f90 !
use HYPREStructMatrixAddToValues to change the diagonal term of the matrix, to solve the helmholtz eq!
structure solver into:

initialize, setup, add_to_diagonal (over-write a current solver), solve, destroy

For implicit diffusion:
(1) initialize (once)
(2) setup without diagonal (once)
(3) change diagonal (new asolver, save the old one with) (every substep)
(4) solve
(5) destroy this this new asolver (but keep the old one!) (every substep)

  ! CHANGE: CALL DISTRIBUTE GRID BELOW THREE TIMES
  ! CHANGE: AND THEN CALL SAVEGRID BELOW THREE TIMES
